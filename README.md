# crossReference

python utility to crossreference Letterboxd watchlist with libraries of preferred streaming services

## usage

On install, chmod +x-ing and running the crossRef.py script will configure your watchlist based on your Letterboxd username, accept and validate your preferred streaming services, and then print out which films from the watchlist are available on each service.    

On subsequent runs of the script, you can pass -r as a flag to reconfigure the entire setup. If this option is not selected, the script will use your previous configuration of username and preferred services.
